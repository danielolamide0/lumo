# Lumo AI Toy - Enhanced Interactive AI Companion

This project implements "Lumo," an advanced AI companion designed specifically for children. Lumo uses Google's Gemini AI with sophisticated routing, emotional intelligence, and adaptive responses to create engaging, safe, and educational interactions.

## 🌟 Key Features

### **AI-Powered Intelligence**
- **Dynamic Intent Detection:** Uses Gemini AI to intelligently analyze user messages and determine interaction type
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Detects emotions (happy, sad, excited, curious, confused, tired, frustrated, neutral) and adapts responses accordingly
- **Smart Routing:** No keyword matching - pure AI analysis for natural conversation flow

### **Conversational Foundation Architecture**
- **Core Identity:** Shared personality, safety rules, and communication style
- **Chat Foundation:** Conversational abilities shared across ALL modes (not a separate mode)
- **Specialized Modes:** Game, Story, and Learning activities that build on the shared chat foundation
- **Every Interaction:** Core Identity + Chat + Specialization = Perfect AI Companion

### **Specialized Activities**
- **Game Mode:** Interactive games (I Spy, 20 Questions, Word Association, Riddles) with natural conversation
- **Story Mode:** Dynamic storytelling with user choices through collaborative dialogue
- **Learning Mode:** Educational explanations through engaging conversation
- **General Mode:** Open-ended supportive conversation when no specific activity is requested

### **Revolutionary Design Principle**
**No separate "chat mode"** - conversation IS the foundation! Every mode is inherently conversational plus specialized:
- Want to play games? → Conversational gaming
- Want to learn? → Educational conversation
- Want stories? → Storytelling conversation
- Just want to chat? → Supportive conversation

### **Advanced Technical Features**
- **LangGraph Workflow:** Parallel processing with conditional routing for optimal performance
- **Comprehensive Fallback System:** Three-layer fallback (AI Analysis → Text Parsing → Keyword Matching)
- **Analysis Caching:** Optimized performance with intelligent caching to avoid duplicate AI calls
- **Error Handling:** Robust error recovery ensures system always responds gracefully

### **Enhanced User Interface**
- **Multi-Tab Configuration:** Core Identity + Chat Foundation + Specialized Mode editors
- **Real-Time Preview:** View combined prompts before applying changes
- **Prompt Statistics:** Monitor character counts and system performance
- **Interactive Testing:** Built-in examples and testing guidance

Conversational + Specialized Response
```

### **Foundational Architecture**
```
Every Response = Core Identity + Chat Foundation + Specialized Mode + Emotional Context
```

Example:
- **Core Identity:** "You are Lumo, friendly and safe..."
- **Chat Foundation:** "Always maintain engaging conversation..."
- **Game Mode:** "Focus on interactive games while chatting..."
- **Emotional Context:** "The child seems excited, match their energy..."
- **Result:** An enthusiastic gaming conversation perfect for an excited child

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API Key ([Get one here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielolamide0/lumo.git
cd lumo
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
MODEL_NAME=gemini-1.5-flash
```

### 4. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 5. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎮 Running Lumo

### Web Interface (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Open your browser to the displayed URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

### Command Line Interface

```bash
python ai_toy_agent.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### **Multi-Tab Interface**
1. **Core Identity Tab:** Edit Lumo's fundamental personality and safety rules
2. **Chat Foundation Tab:** Configure conversational abilities shared across ALL modes
3. **Game Mode Tab:** Customize gaming specialization (builds on chat foundation)
4. **Story Mode Tab:** Set up storytelling specialization (builds on chat foundation)
5. **Learning Mode Tab:** Define educational specialization (builds on chat foundation)
6. **View Combined Tab:** Preview how Core + Chat + Specialization combine for each mode

### **Testing the Architecture**
- **"I'm bored!"** → Game Mode (Conversational gaming)
- **"Tell me about space"** → Learning Mode (Educational conversation)
- **"I'm sad"** → General Mode (Supportive conversation)

**Notice:** Every response is conversational + specialized!

## 🧠 AI Analysis System

### **Intent Detection**
The system analyzes user messages to determine specialized activity:
- **Game:** Wanting to play games, interactive activities
- **Story:** Requesting narratives, creative tales
- **Learning:** Asking how things work, educational content
- **General:** No specific activity - defaults to supportive conversation

### **Emotion Detection**
Lumo recognizes and adapts to:
- **Happy/Excited:** Matches energy with enthusiasm
- **Sad/Frustrated:** Provides extra comfort and support
- **Curious:** Encourages questions and exploration
- **Tired:** Uses calmer, gentler responses
- **Confused:** Breaks things down simply
- **Neutral:** Standard friendly interaction

### **Fallback System**
1. **Primary:** AI analysis using Gemini for intent and emotion
2. **Secondary:** Text parsing if AI doesn't return JSON
3. **Tertiary:** Keyword matching if API fails
4. **Always responds** gracefully regardless of analysis success

## 🛡️ Safety & Security

- **Child-Safe Design:** All responses filtered for age-appropriate content
- **No Personal Information:** Never requests personal details
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Always encouraging and supportive
- **Emotional Support:** Recognizes distress and guides to adult help
- **Secure API Keys:** Environment variables prevent accidental exposure

## 🔄 Technical Features

### **LangGraph Integration**
- **Conditional Routing:** Intelligent flow control based on AI analysis
- **State Management:** Conversation memory with thread-based persistence
- **Parallel Processing:** Efficient workflow execution
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of API failures

### **Performance Optimization**
